# 'rc_${SERV}' service inhibition script.
#
# Usage: $0 (<enable|disable>)
#
# ${SERV} is a service run by 'rc_apps' through symlink 'rc_${SERV}' .
# Services that can be disabled are present as symlink named '${INITD}/${SERV}_pre' pointing to this script.
# Some services can be already disabled from web gui so no need to use this.
# Not all services can be disabled because essentials.
# This script can be skipped with 'nvram set anc_boot_disable=1' .
#
# Typing: 'rc $SERV disable' the service will be inhibited by 'anc' ('rc_apps') from running at all.
# Typing: 'rc $SERV enable' the service inhibition will be removed and service will be available again.
